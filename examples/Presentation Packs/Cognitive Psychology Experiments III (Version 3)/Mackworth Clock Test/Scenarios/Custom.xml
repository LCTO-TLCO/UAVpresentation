    <item key="Instructions">In this experiment, you will see a clock face on the screen. However, instead of numbers on the clock, there will be small circles at each position (there may be more or fewer than 12 positions on this "clock"). 

Pay attention to the clock: there will be one target circle that is a different color than the other circles. The target circle will travel around the clock like the second hand moves around a standard clock. It will occupy a position on the clock face for a moment and then move to the next position. This target circle will travel in a [DIRECTION] direction.

Your task is to click the left mouse button any time the highlighted target skips a position. If you imagine it like a clock, skipping a position would be like the hand of a clock moving directly from 6 to 8. Any time the target skips a position, click the left mouse button. Try to respond as quickly as possible while still being accurate. 

The task may last awhile, so try to pay attention to the target and try not to miss it when it skips a spot!
